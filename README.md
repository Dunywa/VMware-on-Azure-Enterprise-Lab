# VMware Environment

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design, deployment, and administration of an enterprise VMware environment hosted in Microsoft Azure using nested virtualization.

The lab was built to simulate a real-world virtualization platform and provide hands-on experience with VMware infrastructure administration, Active Directory integration, storage management, networking, High Availability (HA), Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS), and incident troubleshooting.

## Objectives

- Deploy a VMware environment in Azure
- Implement centralized identity services using Active Directory
- Configure shared storage using iSCSI
- Deploy VMware ESXi hosts
- Deploy VMware vCenter Server
- Configure a VMware cluster
- Enable High Availability (HA)
- Enable Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS)
- Deploy workload virtual machines
- Simulate and resolve enterprise VMware incidents

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft Azure
- VMware ESXi
- VMware vCenter Server
- Windows Server 2022
- Active Directory Domain Services
- DNS
- iSCSI Storage
- VMware HA
- VMware DRS

## Architecture

The environment consists of:

- Azure Resource Group
- Virtual Network
- Domain Controller
- Shared Storage Server
- Two VMware ESXi Hosts
- VMware vCenter Server
- Multiple workload virtual machines
