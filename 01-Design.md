# Phase 1 - Design

Designed the architecture, networking, storage, VMware, and Active Directory components.

## Overview

This project was designed to simulate a small-to-medium enterprise VMware environment hosted within Microsoft Azure. The objective was to gain hands-on experience with virtualization, identity services, storage, networking, high availability, and infrastructure troubleshooting in a controlled lab environment.

The design emphasizes enterprise best practices by separating management, storage, virtualization, and workload services into dedicated components.

# Risks and Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Resource Constraints | Proper Azure VM sizing |
| Storage Exhaustion | Capacity monitoring |
| Network Misconfiguration | Segmented design |
| Service Outages | HA configuration |

---

# Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

- Active Directory is operational
- VMware hosts are deployed
- Shared storage is available
- vCenter is operational
- HA and DRS are functional
- Workload VMs are deployed
- Incident scenarios can be reproduced and resolved
